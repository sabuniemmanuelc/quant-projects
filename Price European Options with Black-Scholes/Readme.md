# Price European Options with Black-Scholes

## Overview

This project implements the **Black-Scholes model** to price **European Call and Put options**. The Black-Scholes formula is used to calculate option prices based on the underlying asset's current price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free interest rate, and volatility.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Option Pricing using Black-Scholes**: Calculate European Call and Put option prices.
2. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Compare Black-Scholes prices with Monte Carlo simulation pricing for the same options.
3. **Implied Volatility**: Reverse-engineer implied volatility from market option prices, demonstrating a practical approach to volatility estimation.
